# Introduction to Web Development

This repository contains all of the code for each individual lesson and is broken into three sections. HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Each section contains a folder for each lesson that contains all the code for the project as of the end of that lesson.

The code in these projects is only meant as a reference and should not be directly copied. Instead you should be creating your own web site for your own favorite musician.

The square outside Notre-Dame Cathedral, usually empty early on a Saturday morning, filled with hundreds of policemen on August 19, 1944, all of them converging on the fortress-like Prefecture of Police headquarters. A flag unfurled atop the building: the blue, white and red French tricolor, banned by Paris’ German occupiers and last flown officially four years prior. The French police, on strike against the occupation, had returned, this time in revolt. Paris’ uprising against the Nazis had begun.

Across the City of Light, gunfire crackled as Frenchmen hunted and shot German soldiers. Here and there a car roared by, painted with the letters FFI, an abbreviation for the French Forces of the Interior, a coalition of resistance fighters. American and British troops, who’d invaded Normandy two months earlier, were pushing the German Army east, but they were still 150 miles away from the French capital. Parisians rose up to avenge France’s 1940 defeat by the Nazis and their subsequent years of oppression, hoping to liberate the city themselves.
The risk was huge, the decision contentious. Some resistance leaders had feared starting a bloodbath and provoking German reprisals that might destroy the city. Their fears were justified. Just a few weeks earlier, Adolf Hitler had ordered Dietrich von Choltitz, his top general in Paris, to “stamp out” any insurrection “without pity.” Since then, Choltitz had also received orders to destroy Paris’ waterworks and power plants, as well as dozens of bridges over the River Seine: historic landmarks, from the centuries-old Pont Neuf to the stunning Pont Alexandre III.

As Paris’ revolt grew, Hitler’s orders to Choltitz escalated. On August 20, the Nazi leader demanded “the widest destruction possible” in the city. On August 23, Hitler dictated another order. “Paris must not fall into the hands of the enemy,” read the führer’s cable to Choltitz, “or, if it does, he must find there nothing but a field of ruins.”
Why didn’t the German Army destroy Paris, as Hitler wanted? The answer is surprisingly simple: Because the Paris uprising forced Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower’s hand.

Eisenhower hadn’t planned to liberate Paris, but rather to encircle it so he could use the Allies’ limited fuel to drive Hitler’s armies back to the German border. The Paris uprising made the American general “damned mad,” he later told Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, authors of the 1965 nonfiction book Is Paris Burning? It was “just the kind of a situation I didn’t want, a situation that wasn’t under our control, that might force us to change our plans before we were ready for it,” Eisenhower said.
